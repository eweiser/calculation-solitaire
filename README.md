# Calculation Solitaire
My favorite variation of solitaire, serving as my React guinea pig.

## Run it yourself
From the base project directory:

`npm install` to install all project dependencies, and

`npm start` to start up the game locally over port 3000.

Then visit http://localhost:3000 and play on. Good luck!

## TODOs

- Get rid of the god-awful inline CSS (sorry everyone)
- Implement a shortcut to regain focus on the focusable cards if focus has been clicked away
